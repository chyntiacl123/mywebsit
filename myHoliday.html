    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Chyntia Laura Tampubolon</strong>. I want to tell you a little about several events during the holidays. When the holidays lasted more or less 4 months, I decided to take a summer class / solid semester at the beloved campus of Advent Indonesia University.</p>
    <p><em>The summer class was held on June 17 2024</em>. Before starting summer classes, I followed the registration steps first as per campus regulations. After registration took place, I took summer classes according to the schedule determined by the campus. 
        During the summer class, I met friends who had different majors from me. Coincidentally, the informatics engineering major on campus could only take 7 credits during the summer class, which was different from the nursing major. during the summer class I learned a lot about knowledge that I didn't know that was given by the lecturer, not only that, during the summer class I learned a lot to get up quickly again after I had gone through my 2 month holiday before the summer class was held. However, on the other hand, this summer class is boring for me because the campus is very quiet, plus there are assignments that must be done as a responsibility as a student . </p>
    <p>However, behind it all, there is a positive side that I took, that even though it was quiet while taking summer classes, I could focus more on doing something better.
         And thank God, during the summer class which lasted approximately 2 months, I studied well and went smoothly until the final exam, even though there were many assignments that haunted my mind. 
         I am grateful to my friends who also took part in the Summer Class and the lecturers who were always patient in teaching us during this Summer Class. 
         I love you allðŸ¤—ðŸ’—.
